"""ExecutionGateway — the single mechanical path from an approved trade to a
recorded fill.

The canonical entry tail historically lived in
``TradingEngine._build_and_place_order`` and was reimplemented, divergently,
inside every standalone strategy. This component extracts that tail so the
strategies (and exits) route through one place and the duplication — the source
of token/accounting bugs — is deleted.

The gateway changes *who* calls the money path, never the path itself: routing,
the ``place_order`` triple-gate (kill-switch / geoblock / live-enabled), the
paper fork, and ``record_fill`` all keep their existing behavior. Risk
evaluation stays with the caller — the caller passes the already risk-approved
``size_dollars`` and ``force_paper`` on the intent.

``submit`` runs the single-leg path. ``submit_paired`` runs a both-or-nothing
pair (the arb pillars): it builds BOTH orders before placing EITHER, places A
then B, and unwinds a live-pending A if B fails — preserving the atomicity a
per-leg ``submit`` could not.

``cancel_resting`` closes the other half of a resting order's lifecycle. It is
a ROUTING AND AUDIT contract, not a gate: unlike a placement, a cancel reduces
exposure, so it carries none of ``submit``'s risk checks and cannot refuse.
See its docstring for why the kill switch must never reach it.

    THE single predicate for "did this order become a position". Every caller
    that writes a ``portfolio`` row, a per-leg record, or a fill must ask this
    and nothing else.

    It is deliberately the same expression ``_record_result`` applies before it
    writes the fill (``status in _FILLED_STATUSES and filled_size > 0``) — and
    that method now calls THIS function, so the agreement holds by
    construction rather than by nine hand-copied predicates staying in sync. A
    pillar's portfolio row can no longer claim a position the gateway's own
    ``fills``/``cost_basis`` writes never recorded.

    Why the test has to be both halves:

    ``status``      Polymarket's LIVE ``place_order`` ALWAYS returns
                    ``"pending"``, and ``PaperTrader`` defers every
                    non-marketable (maker-priced) order to ``"pending"`` too.
                    Resting is the NORMAL outcome, not the exception.
    ``filled_size`` a ``"paper"``/``"filled"`` status with size 0 is a refusal
                    that got stamped, not an execution — and every
                    ``_record_*`` helper in the codebase falls back to
                    ``order.size`` when ``filled_size`` is 0, so booking one
                    writes a FULL-SIZE phantom.

    Accepts either half of the pair so one predicate covers both call shapes:
    an :class:`ExecutionResult` from the gateway (pillars) or a raw
    :class:`OrderResult` from an exchange adapter / the order monitor. An
    ``ExecutionResult`` that never reached placement carries ``result=None``
    (``status="skipped"``), which is not a position either.

    ``status`` is read from the object the caller passed and ``filled_size``
    from the underlying ``OrderResult``. For an ``OrderResult`` those are the
    same object; for an ``ExecutionResult`` the two agree by construction —
    ``_record_result`` is the ONLY place that builds one carrying a
    ``result``, and it copies ``status=result.status`` verbatim. Attribute
    probing rather than ``isinstance`` so a test double of either shape is
    read the same way the real object would be.

    THE single maintainer of a paper ``portfolio`` row after a booked fill,
    called from the gateway's ``_record_result`` (instant paper fills — entries
    AND exits) and from the order monitor's deferred-fill path. One
    implementation so the two cannot diverge — the same doctrine as
    :func:`booked_as_position` above.

    Why anything must do this at all: ``PnLTracker.record_fill`` writes
    ``fills`` and ``cost_basis`` and NOTHING else, and position sync is
    mode-scoped (``is_paper_flag = 0 if settings.is_live else 1``), so in a
    live bot nothing else maintains paper rows. On the ENTRY side that left
    deferred fills invisible to ``RiskManager`` and every pillar's
    ``_open_position_count`` (measured 2026-08-06: 13 such long_horizon rows
    and 18 llm rows, all settling correctly yet uncounted). On the EXIT side
    the mirror image shipped a day later: an exit that filled INSTANTLY
    through paper interception zeroed ``cost_basis`` and left the portfolio
    row at FULL SIZE until resolution cleanup (observed live 2026-08-06, the
    evening after the deferred-fill fix deployed) — inflating exposure and
    ``max_open`` counts for however long the market kept trading.

    PROJECTED FROM cost_basis, not from the triggering fill, so the two
    cannot diverge. ``cost_basis`` carries the CUMULATIVE size and
    weighted-average cost for (market, token, mode) across every fill — a
    fill-shaped upsert would undercount the second fill in a market (the
    portfolio upsert REPLACES size) and would leave a stale full-size row
    after a partial exit. It is also the exact row
    ``resolution_tracker._settle_position`` falls back to when no portfolio
    row exists.

    Cannot double-book at settlement. ``_settle_position`` reads the
    portfolio row OR the cost_basis row (portfolio preferred) to obtain
    (size, entry_price), but derives its idempotency key from neither:
    ``source_ref = f"settle:{market_id}:{canon_token}:{is_paper_flag}"``
    comes from the position KEY alone, and ``_prior_settlement`` dedupes on
    it. Materializing the row therefore changes only WHICH branch supplies
    the numbers — and both branches read the same cost_basis values.
    ``side`` is hardcoded "BUY" for the same reason ``_settle_position``'s
    cost_basis branch hardcodes it: Polymarket holdings are always long.

    SCOPED to the prediction-market venues whose paper holdings ``portfolio``
    actually represents. The IBKR arms route their simulated fills through
    the gateway for the rails (``fills``/``cost_basis``/``pnl_ledger`` —
    without those the book cannot graduate) but keep positions in their own
    ``ibkr_*`` tables; a portfolio row for one would leak into the
    paper-breadth cap, the drawdown fallback and the exit monitor, none of
    which manage that book. Kraken rows are pillar-owned and never pass
    through here.

    ``venue`` must be the CALLER's venue truth — the gateway passes its
    venue-scoped ``exchange_name``. ``Order.exchange`` is deliberately not
    consulted: its ``"polymarket"`` DEFAULT is truthy, so an
    ``order.exchange or exchange_name`` fallback silently mislabels every
    order whose builder left the field alone (the kalshi long_horizon
    instance does exactly that, and its portfolio rows must say kalshi).

        its own cadence. At decision time that row frequently does not exist:
        measured 2026-07-28, 51 of 111 filled decisions were on markets the
        recorder had never sampled, and the remainder missed on token_id
        (Kalshi orders carry ticker-style ids while the book holds Polymarket
        CLOB numerics).

        The consequence was total. best_ask landed NULL, so _place_and_record
        could not tell whether a paper fill crossed and stamped it 'synthetic'
        — which is not in graduation.credible_fill_evidence. 109 of 111 filled
        decisions were therefore uncountable FOREVER, and with
        require_executable_fills on, no strategy could graduate on merit.

        Recording the state actually used, rather than hoping another component
        recorded it first, is the fix. Best-effort by construction: any failure
        leaves the previous behaviour untouched.

        CLAUDE.md rule 3 makes the gateway the single mechanical path for an
        order's lifecycle, but until this existed only PLACEMENT had a contract:
        every cancel in the codebase — including the market maker's three, and
        the gateway's own paired unwind — reached past the choke point straight
        to ``ExchangeClient.cancel_order``. The rule asserted an invariant its
        own enforcer violated.

        THIS IS A ROUTING AND AUDIT CONTRACT, NOT A GATE. It cannot return
        "blocked" and it has no condition that refuses. A placement adds
        exposure and is therefore gated fifteen ways by ``RiskManager``; a
        cancel REMOVES exposure, so every one of those checks is not merely
        unnecessary here but backwards.

        *** DO NOT ADD A KILL-SWITCH CHECK BELOW (noted 2026-08-06). ***
        This is the specific mistake to avoid, and it looks helpful. #408 made
        arming the kill switch RETIRE live exposure by cancelling resting
        orders (``AuramaurBot._cancel_resting_live_orders``). A cancel path the
        kill switch could block would therefore trap the operator inside the
        exposure the emergency stop exists to shed — the emergency stop would
        become an exposure lock. The kill switch belongs on ``place_order``,
        where it already is, and nowhere on this path.

        What the contract DOES provide:

        * **Paper interception.** A paper order never reaches a venue client.
          Quoting runs paper orders through the LIVE client object (paper-ness
          is per-order ``dry_run``, not a separate adapter), so this is a real
          boundary, not a formality.
        * **Terminal-state bookkeeping.** The trades mirror goes 'cancelled'
          rather than lingering 'pending' forever — the same repair
          ``_cancel_resting_live_orders`` and the order monitor's TTL sweep
          each hand-rolled (#94).
        * **A uniform result type** and one greppable audit event.
        * **Exception containment.** A venue error is REPORTED, never raised:
          these run inside a quoting loop, and callers already treated cancels
          as best-effort.

        ``exchange``/``exchange_name`` default to the gateway's own, exactly as
        ``submit`` resolves them; a cross-venue caller passes its own the way
        ``submit_exit`` and ``submit_paired`` do.
