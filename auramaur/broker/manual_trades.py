"""Manual-trade sweep — book off-bot Polymarket exits into the P&L ledger.

The 2026-08-05 incident: the operator manually sold two bot-held positions at
the venue (markets 3206142/3206143). The position mirror correctly reconciled
HOLDINGS — the cost_basis/portfolio rows vanished on the next sync cycle and
the cash appeared — but no ``pnl_ledger`` 'sell' event was ever booked, so
+$37.70 of term_structure's realized P&L silently vanished from attribution
and had to be booked by hand. This module closes that gap: it polls the venue's
per-wallet trade history (``data-api.polymarket.com/trades``), identifies
trades the bot did NOT place, and books manual SELLs of bot-held positions as
``kind='sell'`` ledger events.

Bot-vs-manual predicate
-----------------------
A venue SELL is classified BOT-PLACED iff live ``fills`` rows exist for the
same (market, token, side='SELL') whose timestamps are within ±10 minutes of
the venue trade AND whose total size covers the venue trade's size within 2%
(``trade.size <= 1.02 * sum(in-window fill sizes)``). Summing — rather than
requiring a single 2%-matching fill — also covers the split-fill shape where
the venue reports one bot order as several partial trade rows (each partial is
contained by the order's one fills row) or one venue row against several bot
fills. The deliberate bias is conservative: any same-side bot activity in the
window large enough to explain the venue row claims it, because a false "bot"
classification loses one booking (recoverable by hand, exactly the pre-module
state) while a false "manual" would DOUBLE-BOOK realized P&L. As a second
independent guard, a venue SELL is also skipped when an existing
``pnl_ledger`` sell row with ``source_ref LIKE 'fill:%'`` matches the same
market/token with qty within 2% and ``realized_at`` within the same ±10-minute
window — catching a bot exit whose fills row was renamed/purged after booking.
BUYs get the same classification but are never booked either way: the
cost_basis mirror (bot._task_position_sync) absorbs venue buys into the
venue-netted avg price on the next cycle; manual buys are logged
(``manual_trades.buy_observed``) so they stay visible.

Holdings / prune interaction
----------------------------
This sweep books the LEDGER EVENT ONLY — it never drains cost_basis or
portfolio. Verified against bot.py's ``_task_position_sync`` (live branch):
the cost_basis mirror overwrites ``size``/``avg_cost`` with venue truth every
cycle (``ON CONFLICT ... SET size = excluded.size``) and DELETEs any live
Polymarket row whose token the venue no longer reports (the stale-remove
DELETE with ``token_id NOT IN (...)`` — this is what erased the incident's
rows within one cycle). Holdings are therefore fully mirror-owned; a drain
here would be redundant at best and would fight the mirror at worst. The
sweep must run BEFORE the reconcile/mirror in the cycle so the cost_basis row
still exists when its exit is booked.

P&L basis and precision
-----------------------
Preferred basis is the live cost_basis row for (market, token) — the
token-scoped average the mirror maintains. If the row is already pruned (the
sweep can run after the exit's mirror cycle, e.g. across a restart), the basis
is reconstructed from live entry fills for that market/token: a
weighted-average walk in timestamp order, BUYs blending the average, SELLs
reducing size (average unchanged) — the same accounting as
``ledger.backfill_ledger``. Precision limits, in both branches: entry fees are
not capitalized into the basis; positions acquired before fill history began
(or absorbed off-bot via the mirror) carry the venue's netted average rather
than a true entry ledger; earlier venue-trade bookings do not reduce the
walk's residual size, so a second manual sell in the same window can book
against a stale (over-stated) holdable qty — the per-unit P&L is still
correct because a weighted average is invariant under sells. If no basis
exists at all, the trade is logged (``manual_trades.no_basis``) and skipped —
never book fabricated P&L.

Cursor and idempotency
----------------------
The cursor (``manual_trade_state``, one row per venue, unix seconds) persists
the newest processed trade timestamp. On first run it initializes to NOW and
the run books nothing: NO historical backfill, because pre-existing off-bot
exits were hand-booked under ``manual-sell:*`` refs and a backfill would
double-book them under ``venue-trade:*`` refs. The cursor only ever advances
(MAX upsert) and only after a successful fetch — a request failure raises and
leaves it untouched. Booking is idempotent by construction: ``source_ref``
``venue-trade:<transactionHash>`` and the column is UNIQUE. If one on-chain
transaction carries several distinct trades (one hash, many rows), only the
first books — a conservative under-count, consistent with the false-"bot"
bias above. Per booked trade, the daily_stats accrual and the cursor advance
land in one ``manual_trades.sweep`` transaction span AFTER the ledger row's
own commit; a crash between the two leaves the ledger row as the idempotent
anchor, and the retry takes the skip path (the stats accrual is then lost,
the same documented trade-off as ResolutionTracker._settle_position).
