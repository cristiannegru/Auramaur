"""Read the IBKR ETF arms' forecast calibration from resolved outcomes.

Why this exists. The ETF arms' entry gate is
``AND(confidence >= etf_min_confidence, probability >= etf_min_prob)``, and its
defaults (MEDIUM / 0.62) were tuned for MomentumETFAnalyzer, which returns
0.70/"HIGH" by construction. The OpenAI arms are asked for a *calibrated*
probability and told weak evidence "should remain near 0.50 with LOW
confidence", so they produced 0.43-0.56 topping out at MEDIUM_LOW and the gate
rejected 100% of them. Per-arm overrides now exist (``etf_arm_min_prob`` /
``etf_arm_min_confidence``) but are deliberately empty: picking a number before
any forecast had resolved would have been fitting to unscored output.

This module is what makes that number choosable from evidence instead. It is
pure — rows in, statistics out — so the arithmetic is testable without a DB.

The central honesty device is the Wilson lower bound. A 5-session directional
forecast is a coin flip until proven otherwise, so the question is never "is the
observed hit rate above 50%" (it will wander above 50% by luck) but "is it
*reliably* above 50% at this sample size". ``samples_for_reliable_edge``
answers the operator's real question — how much longer to wait — instead of
inviting a threshold to be read off twenty noisy resolutions.

KNOWN LIMITATION, and it cuts one way only. Every interval here assumes
independent observations. The ETF arms' forecasts are not: ~28 instruments that
co-move strongly (SPY/VTI/QQQ/XLK are near-duplicates of one factor) are
forecast on overlapping 5-session windows, so a day's 28 rows are far fewer
than 28 independent facts. The effective sample is therefore well below the row
count and the true interval is WIDER than reported. That makes every bound here
optimistic, which is the safe direction for a gate-opening decision: a
threshold this report refuses to support is genuinely unsupported, while one it
does support still deserves scrutiny. Clustering the standard error by session
date (or by asset class) is the honest upgrade if these numbers ever get close.
