        them only burns LLM calls and yields approved-but-unexecutable
        candidates. Exit/management of held positions runs through the dedicated
        venue-exit path and the portfolio monitor, not this cycle, so dropping
        them here does not affect closing positions. The allocator's skip_held
        remains the correctness backstop; this is a pure efficiency filter.

        Both books are pooled deliberately: in live mode the graduation ladder
        still paper-forces unproven strategies, so their at-cap holdings are
        paper rows — filtering by the global mode alone let those markets
        through to full LLM analysis only to be cap-blocked at the gateway.
        The cost is conservatism if a strategy later graduates while its paper
        book still holds a market (the live entry is skipped, not misplaced).

        Reads cost_basis, NOT portfolio. The gateway's per-(market, token) cap
        check reads cost_basis, so a filter reading portfolio can disagree with
        the gate that will block the order — and did: market 3092787 held
        $16.27 of NO in cost_basis with NO portfolio row at all, so it passed
        this filter, consumed a full LLM analysis and a risk evaluation, and
        was then dropped at placement (2026-07-25 23:20). portfolio is a
        projection that can lag or lose rows; cost_basis is the authoritative
