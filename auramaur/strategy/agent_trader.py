"""Agent day-trader — the Hermes paradigm rebuilt as a first-class pillar.

The original experiment (agentmcp bridge, PR #209) ran a persistent reasoning
agent as an EXTERNAL process with unconstrained writes to its own ledger. It
answered a different question than intended: given write access to its own
scorecard, the agent fabricated it (see agentmcp/book.py S4). This pillar is
the honest rebuild — the same paradigm under test (does a memory-carrying
judgment agent beat the stateless strategy ensemble?) but riding the bot's own
rails: signals + trades attribution, the FULL RiskManager gate (all 15 checks,
never bypassed), ExecutionGateway placement, and settlement by the resolution
tracker. The agent cannot touch its own ledger; it can only emit opinions.

THE INTELLIGENCE-CAP A/B: the pillar runs the SAME mandate, prompt, candidate
set, and memory format across MULTIPLE models (``agent_trader.models``). Each
model is its own attribution cell — ``strategy_source = agent_trader_<alias>``
— so ``auramaur pnl --paper`` and the graduation ladder segment them
independently. If judgment quality is the binding constraint on directional
edge, the cells should separate by model tier; if they don't, the constraint
is elsewhere (information, market selection, execution) and more intelligence
won't buy edge.

Persistent judgment: every decision is stored in ``agent_trader_theses`` with
its one-sentence thesis; at prompt time the model sees its own alias's recent
CLOSED trades joined to realized P&L (the feedback loop) plus its open book.
Memory is per-alias — models never see each other's reasoning, or the cells
would correlate.

Paper-forced (config ``paper: true`` AND every cell is a new directional cell
under the enforced graduation ladder). Entries only in v1 — near-dated markets
(default <= 30d) keep the book turning over; exits are engine-level and
settlement-based, like bias_harvest/long_horizon.
