"""Resolution-language lens — trade the gap between headline and fine print.

The bot's best documented wins share one shape: the crowd prices the
HEADLINE event, but the resolution criteria resolve something subtly
different — "Will X ANNOUNCE Y?" (statement risk), "PERMANENT peace deal"
(permanence bars), literal model counting (LMArena ranks), compound
conditions and deadlines. An LLM reading 400 words of fine print
adversarially is exactly the asymmetry this bot has over casual flow.

Pipeline per cycle:
  1. Lexical triggers select candidate markets (announce/officially/
     permanent/exact-count/compound phrasing) — cheap, no LLM.
  2. Real-book guards (liquidity, spread, resolution window, blocked
     categories) — no price is believed on a dead book.
  3. The LENS PROMPT reads the criteria adversarially BOTH ways ("how does
     YES resolve without the headline event — and how does the event happen
     without YES resolving?") and returns a strict-criteria fair price, a
     gap_score, and the named mechanism. Verdicts cache permanently
     (criteria are static).
  4. Trade only when gap_score and |fair - market| clear config floors.
     Lens signals are BORN with mispricing_reason set ("behavioral: ..."),
     so the name-the-gap risk gate passes without a second audit call.

PAPER-FORCED by default; one shot per market; rides the standard rails as
strategy_source='resolution_lens', scored by the graduation ladder.

Current market price (YES): {market_prob:.2f}
Today's date is {today}. Interpret EVERY date in the criteria relative to today, including 2-digit years (e.g. '26 = 2026). A resolution date that is today, imminent, or already past resolves on NEAR-TERM reality (current forecasts/observations) — it is NOT a distant-future climatological base-rate bet. Never invent a "distant year, revert to base rate" mechanism for a near-term or already-passed market; that is a misread of the current year, not a fine-print edge.

Answer BOTH directions:
1. How can YES resolve WITHOUT the headline event most people imagine actually happening?
2. How can the headline event happen WITHOUT YES resolving (qualifying language, deadlines, required sources, permanence/officiality bars, literal counting rules, compound conditions)?

Then estimate the fair P(YES) under a STRICT reading of the written criteria — not the vibe. If the criteria and the headline reading genuinely coincide, say so with gap_score 0.

Respond with ONLY this JSON:
