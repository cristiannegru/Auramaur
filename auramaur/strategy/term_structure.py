"""Term-structure pillar — price a deadline ladder off ONE reading of the event.

Deadline families ("X by July 10?", "X by July 17?", … — 70+ active families,
some with 13 strikes spanning 1c-90c) are priced strike-by-strike by the
crowd, independently. But the strikes share one underlying question: WHEN, if
ever, does the event happen. This pillar reads the family once — rules plus
current evidence, one LLM call — into an event-time curve (P(event by each
listed deadline)), then prices EVERY strike off that curve and trades the
largest gaps. One call amortizes across the whole ladder, which is the direct
answer to the budget-throughput constraint that starves per-market readers
(the lens); and a curve fit is structurally immune to the "right story,
wrong strike" failure observed in the per-market reads.

The reading-edge thesis this operationalizes: an LLM can out-READ the crowd —
resolution rules, registers, deadlines, term structure — not out-forecast it.
The curve is a timeline judgment anchored on the family's own resolution
criteria, not a world-model prophecy.

Deterministic sanity comes free: within a family, P(by T1) <= P(by T2) for
T1 < T2. Violations are logged (entailment_arb owns trading them); the model
curve itself is isotonic-clamped so a noisy read can't emit an impossible
curve.

Data hygiene (why candidates come from live discovery, not the markets
table): stored end_date is NULL or wrong for many ladder strikes and
resolved markets freeze active=1, so families are built from the dated
discovery scan and the deadline is parsed from the QUESTION TEXT.

Rides the standard rails: signals + trades attribution, full RiskManager
gate, ExecutionGateway placement, resolution-tracker settlement. PAPER-FORCED
(new directional cell under the enforced graduation ladder). One position per
market bot-wide (settlement attribution is market-scoped for same-token
stacks; see agent_trader for the same rule and rationale).
