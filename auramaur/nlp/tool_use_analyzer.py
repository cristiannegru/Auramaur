"""Tool-use analyzer — Claude Code drives its own web_search / web_fetch.

Used as a refinement step after the strategic batch: for markets where the
batch surfaced a strong edge, we re-ask Claude with ``WebSearch`` and
``WebFetch`` enabled so it can look up specifics (resolution criteria,
recent developments, primary sources) rather than relying only on the
pre-aggregated evidence.

Works by shelling out to ``claude -p`` with ``--allowedTools
WebSearch,WebFetch`` and ``--json-schema`` for structured output, matching
the existing ``ClaudeAnalyzer._call_claude_cli`` pattern.

Fails open: on timeout / parse error / budget exhaustion, returns ``None``
so the caller falls back to the batch result.

Your task: use WebSearch and WebFetch to verify or refine this estimate.
Focus on:
  1. What SPECIFIC information is needed to decide this? (resolution criteria, named entities, dates)
  2. Has anything material happened recently that the batch analysis might have missed?
  3. Does the prior estimate hold up when you look at primary sources, or should it be revised?

Output STRICT JSON matching this schema:

Be parsimonious with tool calls — aim for 2-4 searches total. If after
searching you don't find evidence that materially changes the prior estimate,
return a probability close to it and say so in the reasoning.
